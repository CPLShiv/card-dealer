REQUIREMENTS FOR PROJECT:
Make sure you have the following:
//Create a Singleton Class 
//Create a new instance of Singleton 
// Get unique id for instance object 

Write an application that uses the Singleton design pattern. You will have two card players, player 1 and player 2. Each card player will be dealt a hand from the deck in the list as shown below. (You can create the deck of cards any way that you want to. This was something I did for students who weren't sure where to even begin.) The objective is to use the Singleton pattern to make sure that only one instance of a class is created (display the unique ID). Provide a global point of access to the object. Display the cards dealt to player 1 and player 2.   



The "Singleton" Class is Deck.java.
